# Horiseon Refactor Challenge

## Overview

The objective is to recieve the source code for the Horiseon website and refactor it.

---

## My goal is to...

* Make the webpage more accessible
* Add semantic elements
* Make all links functional
* Make the CSS code more efficient, and organized
* Not break anything

## What are semantic elements?

A semantic element is an element that describes its meaning or function.

### This is an example of semantic html

```html
<header>
  <h1>
    This is a header
  </h1>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>
    Example
  </h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            This is an example of semantic html
        </p>
    </section>
</section>
```
### This is not an example not semantic hmtl

```html
<div>
  <h1>
    This is a header
  </h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>
    Example
  </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            This is an example of not semantic html
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Semantic html not only helps developers understand your code, but helps browsers, and assistive technology as well.

## Preview
This is a preview of what the html source code for the Horiseon webpage used to look like.

This is bad practice because it does not make the code easily readable or accessible, and it very difficult to know where things are.
